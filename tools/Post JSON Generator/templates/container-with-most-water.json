  "problem": "An array of integers naturally defines a set of lines parallel to the Y-axis, starting from x = 0 as illustrated in the following figure. The goal of this problem is to find the pair of lines that together with the X-axis \"trap\" the most water. <p> Write a program which takes as input an integer array and returns the pair of entries that trap the maximum amount of water. <p> <img src=\"http:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/bradstewart\/epi-online\/master\/static\/posts\/trapped-water-1.png\"\/> <p> <i>A graphical depiction of the array {1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1}</i><p> <img src=\"http:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/bradstewart\/epi-online\/master\/static\/posts\/trapped-water-2.png\"\/> <p> <i>The shaded area between 4 and 16 is the maximum water that can be trapped by the array</i>"
