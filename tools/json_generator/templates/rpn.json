  "problem": "A string is said to be an arithmetical expression in reverse Polish notation (RPN) if: <ol> <li> It is a single digit or a sequence of digits, prefixed with an optional <b>-</b> </li> <li>It is of the form \"A, B, o\" where A and B are RPN expression and o is one of <b>+</b>, <b>-</b>, <b>Ã—</b>, <b>\/</b> </li> </ol> An RPN expression can be evaluated uniquely to an integer. Here is an example of an RPN expression. <pre>7, 3, +, 4, 2, /, / = (7+3) / (4/2) = 5 </pre> <p> Write a program that takes an arithmetical expression in RPN and returns the number that the expression evaluates to."
