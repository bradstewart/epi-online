  "problem": "Sudoku is a popular logic-based combinatorial number placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9 x 9 grid with digits subject to the constraint that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-grids that compose the grid contains unique integers in [1, 9]. The grid is initialized with a partial assignment as shown in <IMAGE HERE>; a complete solution is shown in <IMAGE HERE>.\r\n\r\nImplement a Sudoku solver. The program takes 2D grid of integers, where zero means an undefined cell and numbers greater than zero represents cells with known value. The task is to eleminate all zeros in respect of mentioned constraints.",
